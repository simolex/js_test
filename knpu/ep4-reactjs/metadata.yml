summary: |
    ReactJS! Woohoo! With ES6 and webpack behind us, we can finally have some *serious*
    fun! In this course, we'll introduce ReactJS, get it working through Webpack
    and starting building a real application. We'll talk about some of the best
    ways to get your React app to talk to Symfony, including authentication!

    * Components & React Architecture
    * Jumping into JSX!
    * Getting used to props vs state
    * Server-side ReactJS Rendering
    * Authentication With Symfony
    * Making API Calls back to Symfony
    * Returning JSON and massaging it in React
    * Handling collections in React
    * Modifying state in a parent component
